This project is the demo for an upcoming talk I am giving for the ReactJS San
Francisco Bay Area meetup:

https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-San-Francisco/events/232714881/

I will release slides and more info here after the talk.  In the mean time you
can play with the demo via `npm start` and clicking around.  Note - some of the
jokes may be spoiled.

Also - there is a bunch of commented code - that code serves as variants on the
demo for people who may have questions.  It also shows off some differing
solutions to the issue that I will be discussing.
